## Tools Missing from PATH (not installed)

These tools registered in `tools.py` / `pipeline.py` but binary not found:

| Module | Binary | Pipeline Phase | Impact |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| `arjun` | `arjun` | js_analysis / param_mine | No parameter mining |
| `cloud_enum` | `cloud_enum` | secrets / cloud_enum | No cloud bucket brute-force |
| `cloudlist` | `cloudlist` | infrastructure / cloudlist | No cloud asset enumeration (returns 0) |
| `linkfinder` | `linkfinder` | js_analysis / js_endpoints | No JS endpoint extraction |
| `mapcidr` | `mapcidr` | (util) | No CIDR expansion |
| `puredns` | `puredns` | dns_brute fallback | Only used if dnsx missing |
| `secretfinder` | `secretfinder` | js_analysis / js_secrets | No JS secret scanning |
| `subjack` | `subjack` | infrastructure | Binary missing but tool returned result — check install |
| `urlfinder` | `urlfinder` | crawling | Binary missing but tool returned result — check install |
| `graphqlmap` | `graphqlmap` | (util) | Not wired to pipeline |

**Install commands:**
```bash
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/urlfinder/cmd/urlfinder@latest
go install github.com/hakluke/hakrawler@latest   # alternative to linkfinder
pip install arjun
pip install LinkFinder
pip install SecretFinder
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/cmd/cloudlist@latest
```

## Duplicate Tools — Same Task, Multiple Implementations

### 1. Tech Detection (HIGHEST PRIORITY — currently duplicated)

| Module | Tool | Method |
|--------|------|--------|
| `wappalyzer` | httpx `-tech-detect` on all hosts | Per-host, writes to DB |
| `wappalyzergo` | httpx `-tech-detect` single target | Per-target tool |

**Decision needed:** `wappalyzer` (pipeline module) and `wappalyzergo` (tools.py) both use the exact same `httpx -tech-detect` command. They produce identical output. **Recommend removing `wappalyzergo` from the pipeline** — `wappalyzer` already does this and saves results to DB.

---

### 2. URL Discovery — 3 overlapping tools

| Module | Tool | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `wayback` | `gau` + Wayback CDX | Historical URLs |
| `urlfinder` | `urlfinder` | Wayback + CommonCrawl + OTX |
| `js` (step 4) | `gau` | Historical JS URLs |

**Decision needed:** `wayback` (recon.py via `gau`) and `urlfinder` (UrlfinderTool via `urlfinder`) query the same sources (Wayback, OTX, CommonCrawl). `gau` is also called inside `run_js_recon` to find historical JS URLs.
- `wayback` focuses on interesting paths / sensitive file detection
- `urlfinder` returns raw URL list (22k+ for tesla)
- `gau` inside `js` filters for `.js` files only

**Recommend:** Keep all three — their scope is differentiated. But remove the `gau` call inside `run_js_recon` (use `urlfinder` output instead).

---

### 3. Subdomain Enumeration — 3 tools used in dns_brute

| Tool | Used in |
|------|---------|
| `subfinder` | (registered in tools.py but NOT called in pipeline) |
| `amass` | (registered in tools.py but NOT called in pipeline) |
| `assetfinder` | (registered in tools.py but NOT called in pipeline) |
| `dnsgen` | `run_dns_bruteforce()` — generates permutations |
| `dnsx` | `run_dns_bruteforce()` — resolves permutations |

**Decision needed:** `subfinder`, `amass`, and `assetfinder` are installed and registered but NEVER called in any pipeline phase! They are powerful passive subdomain tools. `run_dns_bruteforce` only does permutation-based discovery from existing seeds.

**Recommend:** Add a `subdomain_enum` module that runs subfinder + amass passively (no brute-force) before the `dns_brute` permutation phase.

---

### 4. Vhost Discovery — 2 tools

| Tool | Used in |
|------|---------|
| `vhost-ffuf` | (registered, not in pipeline) |
| `vhost-gobuster` | (registered, not in pipeline) |
| `vhost` (recon.py) | Pipeline phase 5 — uses ffuf internally |

**Decision needed:** `VHostFfufTool` and `VHostGobusterTool` are registered but not in the pipeline. The pipeline uses `run_vhost_discovery()` in recon.py which already uses ffuf. Duplicates.

**Recommend:** Remove `vhost-ffuf` and `vhost-gobuster` from the pipeline (they're already used internally by `run_vhost_discovery`). Keep them in `tools.py` for manual runs only.

---

### 5. JS Analysis — 3 overlapping modules

| Module | Tool | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `js` | katana + subjs + getJS + gau | Discover JS + scan for secrets/endpoints |
| `js_endpoints` | linkfinder (MISSING) | Extract endpoints from JS |
| `js_secrets` | secretfinder (MISSING) | Extract secrets from JS |

**Decision needed:** `js` already does what `js_endpoints` and `js_secrets` do — it discovers JS files, scans for endpoints AND secrets. Since `linkfinder` and `secretfinder` are not installed, `js_endpoints` and `js_secrets` are dead weight.

**Recommend:** Remove `js_endpoints` and `js_secrets` from the pipeline. Enhance `run_js_recon` if needed.

---

### 6. Cloud/Bucket Discovery — 3 tools

| Module | Tool | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `cloud` | recon.py `run_cloud_assets` | HTTP probing of known bucket patterns |
| `cloud_enum` | `cloud_enum` binary (MISSING) | Brute-force bucket names |
| `cloudlist` | `cloudlist` binary | Query cloud provider APIs |

**Decision needed:** All three look for cloud assets differently.
- `cloud` probes known naming patterns (e.g., `tesla.s3.amazonaws.com`)
- `cloud_enum` brute-forces bucket names (not installed)
- `cloudlist` queries cloud provider APIs for registered assets

**Recommend:** Keep `cloud` (working). Install `cloudlist` for API-based discovery. Drop `cloud_enum` (brute-force is noisy and not installed).

---

### 7. Screenshot — 2 implementations

| Module | Tool | Used |
|--------|------|------|
| `screenshot` | gowitness (pipeline module) | Phase 4 |
| `gowitness` | GowitnessTool in tools.py | Manual runs only |

**Decision needed:** `run_screenshots()` in recon.py uses `gowitness` directly. `GowitnessTool` in tools.py wraps the same binary. No pipeline conflict (only `screenshot` is in the pipeline), but tools.py has a redundant wrapper.

**Recommend:** Keep as-is. `GowitnessTool` is useful for manual single-target runs.

## Bugs Fixed in This Session

1. **`check_exposed_git`** — was probing ALL 771 live hosts sequentially (8+ minutes) → capped at 100, 30 workers, 3s timeout
2. **`http_get` gzip** — raw gzip bytes fed to `json.loads()` → auto-decompress added
3. **`search_github`** — duplicate `except` clause (dead code) → removed
4. **`run_js_recon`** — 771+ targets to katana (always timeout) → capped at 30
5. **`run_wappalyzer`** — 1385 targets (300s timeout) → capped live:150+passive:50, 50 threads
6. **`run_api_exposure`** — wrong springboot nuclei template paths → fixed to actual paths
7. **`_run_services`** — sequential 771 hosts (~8h worst case) → parallel 50 hosts
8. **`run_dns_bruteforce`** — misleading `permutations_tried` stat → split into `permutations_generated` vs `permutations_tried`
9. **`run_cve_lookup`** — "no CVEs found" not reported → added info entries with `no_cves: true`
10. **`_persist_pipeline_results`** — CRITICAL: no persistence at pipeline end → added full persist method

## Session 2 Fixes (2026-04-24)

### New Bugs Fixed

| # | Module | Bug | Fix |
|---|--------|-----|-----|
| 11 | `scan_routes.py` | `NameError: name 're' is not defined` in `serve_screenshot()` | Added `import re` to scan_routes.py |
| 12 | `_probe_url` | `retries=2, timeout=5` → up to 15s per URL × 109 paths × 50 hosts = **3h+ hang** | Changed to `retries=0, timeout=4` |
| 13 | `run_vhost_discovery` | 1105-entry wordlist × 10 IPs × 2 ports × 120s timeout = **~40 min** | Capped wordlist at 200, IPs at 5, ffuf timeout at 30s |
| 14 | `CommandTool` | All tools in `bin/` invisible (not in PATH) → subjack/arjun/linkfinder/secretfinder/cloud_enum all errored | Added `_resolve_binary()` checking PATH then `bin/` dir, patched argv[0] in `run()` |
| 15 | `CloudEnumTool.available()` | `bin/cloud_enum` exists but fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: enum_tools` → tool falsely reported available | Added import validation via stderr check |
| 16 | `run_cve_lookup` | No product cap → could query NVD for hundreds of techs at 6s/query = **30+ min** | Capped at 20 products |
| 17 | `_fetch_headers` | `retries=2, timeout=8` → up to 24s per host × 500 hosts / 15 workers = **14+ min** | Changed to `retries=0, timeout=6` |

### Performance Summary (after all fixes)

| Phase | Module | Before | After |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 3 | `waf` | ~25 min (771 hosts) | ~3 min (100 hosts cap) |
| 4 | `headers` | ~14 min (500 hosts, 15w) | ~5 min (200 hosts, 30w) |
| 5 | `vhost` | ~22 min (1105 words, 10 IPs) | ~3 min (200 words, 5 IPs) |
| 6 | `services` | 3h+ hang (retries=2 × CLOSE_WAIT) | ~5 min (retries=0, cap 50) |
| 2 | `dns_brute` | >30 min (953 seeds) | ~1 min (50 seeds) |

### Tools Now Working via local bin/

These tools were previously silently skipped (not in PATH); now resolved via `bin/`:
- `subjack` — subdomain takeover via CNAME
- `arjun` — hidden HTTP parameter mining
- `linkfinder` — JS endpoint extraction
- `secretfinder` — JS secret detection
- `urlfinder` — URL discovery
- `asnmap`, `cloudlist`, etc.

## Session 3 Fixes (2026-04-24 — continued)

### New Bugs Fixed

| # | Module | Bug | Fix |
|---|--------|-----|-----|
| 18 | `LinkFinderTool.parse()` | All stdout lines treated as endpoints — captures `Usage: python ...` and `Error: ...` status messages | Filter lines not starting with `/`, `http://`, `https://`, `./`; skip lines starting with `[`, `Usage:`, `Error:` |
| 19 | `SecretFinderTool.parse()` | All stdout lines treated as secrets — captures `[ + ] URL: https://...` status lines | Only keep lines with `\t->\t` or ` -> ` separator (actual SecretFinder finding format) |
| 20 | `ArjunTool` | `--stable` flag makes arjun very slow; subprocess timeout 120s → arjun runs 250+ requests × 15s/request | Removed `--stable`, added `-T 8 -t 10 -c 250`, reduced subprocess timeout to 90s |
| 21 | `SubjackTool` | 500 hosts × 10s/30 threads = 167s worst case → exceeds 60s subprocess timeout | Capped hosts at 100 (100/30 × 10 = ~33s worst case) |
| 22 | WAF detection | `Server: AkamaiGHost` not in `_WAF_SIGNATURES` → Tesla shows 0 protected hosts despite heavy Akamai use | Added `server:akamaighost`, `akamaiedge`, `ak_bmsc`, `bm_sz`, `x-akamai-ssl-client-sid` to Akamai signatures |

### Verification (Run 3 results)

- Phase 1 (OSINT): All 7 modules done ✅
- Phase 2 (Enumeration): All 3 modules done ✅
- Phase 3 (Infrastructure): portscan/cloud/cloudlist/waf/takeover done; subjack **still errors** (timeout — may need further reduction)
- Phase 4 (Surface): headers 200 hosts / screenshot / wappalyzer / wappalyzergo all done ✅
- Phase 5 (Crawling): wayback 5000 URLs / urlfinder 30 / vhost 0 / js 29 files / api_panels 0 ✅
- Phase 6 (CMS): cms_scan 0 / services 0 (correct — CDN blocks all probes) ✅
- Phase 7 (JS Analysis): js_endpoints 2 / js_secrets 1 / param_mine **timed out** (fixed for next run)
- Phase 8 (Secrets): cloud_enum 0 / favicon_hunt 0 / grep_app **429** (acceptable — external rate limit)
- Phase 9 (Intelligence): certstream / breach / shodan (no keys) / cve 222 findings ✅

## Session 4 Fixes (2026-04-24 — continued)

### New Bugs Fixed

| # | Module | Bug | Fix |
|---|--------|-----|-----|
| 23 | `SubjackTool` | CDN filter reduced hosts cap 100→50 but subjack still timed out due to WHOIS lookups for CDN-hosted domains; SRV records (`_sip._tls.*`) stall subjack | Filter hosts where `waf` contains akamai/cloudfront/fastly/cloudflare; skip `_`-prefixed hostnames; cap at 50 non-CDN hosts → runs in 15s |
| 24 | `_fetch_headers` | `retries=0` → `range(0)` = no iterations → zero HTTP requests made → WAF detection always sees empty headers (0 protected) and headers module reports all missing (cookie_issues=0) | Changed `retries=0` to `retries=1` in `_fetch_headers` |
| 25 | `SubjackTool.parse()` | `"VULNERABLE" in line.upper()` matches "NOT VULNERABLE" (substring); ANSI color codes in subjack output not stripped → 100 false positive "critical" findings per run | Strip ANSI codes before matching; skip lines containing "Not Vulnerable" before the VULNERABLE check |

### Verification (Run 5 results — 2026-04-24)

| Phase | Module | Before | After |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 3 | `subjack` | error (timeout every run) | **done in 15.05s** — CDN filter removes 690+ Akamai hosts ✅ |
| 3 | `waf` | 0 protected (retries=0 bug) | **95/100 protected** (13 Akamai + 82 Unknown WAF) ✅ |
| 3 | `subjack findings` | 100 false positives ("Not Vulnerable") | **0 findings** (correct — no real takeovers found) ✅ |
| 4 | `headers` | cookie_issues=0, missing_hsts=200/200 | **cookie_issues=25**, missing_hsts=126/200 (realistic) ✅ |
| All | Full pipeline | 36/37 modules done (subjack error) | **37/37 done** (only grep_app 429 = rate limit) ✅ |
